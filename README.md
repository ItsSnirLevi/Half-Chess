# Half Chess: A New Take on a Classic Battle!

Welcome to **Half Chess**, where strategy meets speed on a condensed battlefield! In this fresh twist on the classic game, we introduce a dynamic and fast-paced chess experience with a few exciting modifications.

## 🎲 How It Works

- **Unique Board Setup**: The game is played on a board that’s half as wide—just 4 squares across, but the usual 8 squares deep.
- **Condensed Armies**: Each player brings only their strongest right-side warriors: King, Bishop, Knight, and Rook, along with pawns standing guard above.
- **Strategic Pawn Moves**: Pawns can move sideways by one square, adding a new layer of strategy to your game. Remember, sideways moves are for repositioning only—no capturing allowed!

## ⏱ Speed Matters

- Players have limited time to make each move, keeping the game dynamic and thrilling.
- **Miss your timer, and it’s game over!**

## 🖥 Project Overview

- **Server**: Built using .NET Razor, the server allows players to sign up, view, and query game data.
- **Client**: A WinForms application where players log in with their game ID to play and track their game history. Games are recorded and can be replayed in the client.
